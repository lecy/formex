# Generic detector fixture tests. These iterate over the WHOLE registry, so a
# new dt-<family> automatically inherits coverage once it is registered and the
# fixture (data_type_tests) is rebuilt. Two universal invariants:
#   * recall = 1: every valid fixture case passes its own detector.
#   * strict types reject random (S3) negatives at a high rate.
# Inherently-loose types (short-alphabet lookups, numeric ranges) are excluded
# from the precision assertion by design -- their "false positives" are mostly
# genuinely valid values, which the guess_data_type() specificity ranking, not
# the detector, is responsible for disambiguating.
